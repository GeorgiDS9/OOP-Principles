JavaScript is a OOP languagae that has 4 principles. By using objects, we can create clean and reusable code.

Definition of object:

Object is an instance of a class that has methods and properties and class is a blueprint of an object.

Principles:

1. ENCAPSULATION ~ With encapsulation, objectâ€™s methods and properties are enclosed within the object, so there are not exposed.

2. ABSTRACTION ~ hiding complex details and showing simple ones. It helps the code to be more understandable

3. INHERITANCE ~ Inheritance allows for parent class to pass functionality to a child class, again, creating clean and reusable code, avoiding repeats.

4. POLYMORPHYSM ~ means the same method can be used on different objects or the same function is called on different classes.
